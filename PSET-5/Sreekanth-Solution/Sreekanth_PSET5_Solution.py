#We first subtract apple_eaten from total_apple to get the number of apples left in the basket for that we have to make it seperated in a bracket. We then convert this number to a string using the str() function. Then we concatenate it with the other parts of the string using the + operator. The out put of the resulting string to the print() function to display it on the console.
