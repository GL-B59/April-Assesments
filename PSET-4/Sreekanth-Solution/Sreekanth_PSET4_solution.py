#We need to check the apple_left.py file. Try to find if any bugs are present. If yes please fix.

#Correct program as below

total_apple = 10 
apple_eaten = 4
#Below expression will fist do the calsulation and conver it to sting and concatunate with other srings inside the single quote given
print('There are ' + str(total_apple - apple_eaten) + ' left in the basket.')

#We first subtract apple_eaten from total_apple to get the number of apples left in the basket for that we have to make it seperated in a bracket. We then convert this number to a string using the str() function. Then we concatenate it with the other parts of the string using the + operator. The out put of the resulting string to the print() function to display it on the console.
